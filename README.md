# canvas-userscripts

A collection of user scripts to customise the [Canvas Learning Management System](https://www.instructure.com/canvas) from Instructure.

## Overview

A [user script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) is a small piece of JavaScript code that is injected by the browser into a page, after the user has been authenticated and the page has been loaded. The script runs entirely on the client side with the permissions of the user. This allows the user to customise the appearance or extend the behaviour of a page to suit their needs.

To install and run a user script you will need a user script manager for your browser. I recommend [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).

## Scripts

<details>
<summary>maximise-files-list.user.js</summary>
The default file list view is narrow, often making it impossible to see the full name of a file. This user script extends the width of the files list view to fill the width of the browser frame.

<details>
<summary>minimise-gradebook-warnings.user.js</summary>
Warnings displayed above the gradebook consume too much vertical screen real estate. This user script minimises warning banners to maximise space for the gradebook.
